This dataset is a multimodal sentiment dataset, which is collected from Flickr using filckr API. 
This free data set is for training and testing sentiment analysis algorithms. It is comprised of 99,351 weakly labeled multi-modal documents. Each multi-modal document contains an image and its text description.

There are two top-level directories [documents/, images/]. Then there are two second-level directories [trainingset/, testingset/] corresponding to the training and test sets. 
Each contains [positive/, negative/] directories for the documents with binary labels positive and negative. Within these directories, documents are named following the convention [[train/test]_[label]_[id].txt].
